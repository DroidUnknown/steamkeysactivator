steamkeysactivator
==================

Activates Steam Keys in bulks (Mac only)

It's a small and dumb script that reads the currently open Safari/Chrome page,
searches for Steam keys and uses local Steam client to activate them one by one.

It's particularly useful for Humble Bundles.

How to run:

1. Check that you are using Mac OS and not Windows or Linux
1. Download everything to your Mac
1. Run this application
1. Check System Preferences, Security & Privacy, Privacy, Accessibility
1. In case app does not run try to run script itself in a Script Editor

Known to work with:

1. Humble Bundle 14
1. Steam in English April 2015th version
1. Mac OS Yosemite

Good luck!
Feel free to send patches and bugs!
